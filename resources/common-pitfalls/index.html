          Suppose you’re looking to submit a proposal for a conference talk. In
          that case, knowing what to avoid is essential to increase your chances
          of acceptance. Here are nine common pitfalls to watch out for:
        </p>

        <h2 id="sales-pitches">Sales pitches</h2>
        <p>
          Remember that the conference is a community of creators and users of
          open-source scientific computing tools. While you can reference your
          closed-source product or platform, the audience will find the talk
          more interesting if they can try your techniques with the open-source
          PyData stack. Avoid making a hard sell, and focus on problem
          definition, proposed strategies, and business domain instead.
        </p>

        <h2 id="repeated-talks">Repeated talks</h2>
        <p>
          Conferences prefer new talks and new speakers. If your talk is already
          available online, it will unlikely be accepted for the conference. Try
          to bring new insights, techniques, or perspectives on a topic that
          hasn’t been covered before.
        </p>

        <h2 id="lack-of-clarity">Lack of clarity</h2>
        <p>
          Your proposal should clearly communicate what your talk is about and
          what attendees can expect to learn. Suppose your proposal is unclear,
          rambling, or difficult to follow. In that case, reviewers may be
          unable to determine if your talk aligns with the conference’s goals or
          is suitable for the intended audience.
        </p>

        <h2 id="lack-of-originality">Lack of originality</h2>
        <p>
          Reviewers seek unique, insightful, and innovative talks that offer
          fresh perspectives or new solutions to common problems. If your
          proposal covers a topic that has already been covered multiple times
          or doesn’t provide any new insights or techniques, reviewers may pass
          on it. That doesn’t mean a case study or new spin on an issue won’t be
          accepted, but it’s worth considering that added perspective.
        </p>

        <h2 id="overly-long-proposals">Overly long proposals</h2>
        <p>
          Keep your proposal simple and clear. Good proposals typically provide
          all the vital information within 250 words. This is not a strict limit
          and varies per conference. This is a suggestion to help you stay
          focused and avoid losing the attention of the reviewers.
        </p>

        <h2 id="lack-of-relevance">Lack of relevance</h2>
        <p>
          Make sure your talk aligns with the conference’s theme or focus.
          Suppose your proposal is only tangentially related to the conference’s
          goals. In that case, reviewers may not see how it fits into the larger
          picture or how it would benefit attendees.
        </p>

        <h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
        <p>
          While discussing future work is exciting and could be mentioned in
          your talk, the core content of the talk should already be shaped, and
          you should be able to describe it in your proposal. Don’t rely too
          heavily on future data collection or future prototyping because things
          often don’t go as expected. Be sure to provide concrete examples and
          use cases.
        </p>

        <h2 id="inappropriate-or-offensive-content">
          Inappropriate or offensive content
        </h2>
        <p>
          Keep your language and tone professional and respectful, and avoid
          controversial or sensitive topics that could offend or alienate
          attendees. Proposals containing inappropriate, offensive, or
          discriminatory content will likely be rejected.
        </p>

        <h2 id="poor-fit-with-the-conference-format">
          Poor fit with the conference format
        </h2>
        <p>
          Conferences have different formats, from lightning talks to workshops
          to keynote speeches. Ensure your proposal aligns with the format and
          duration of the conference and can be delivered effectively in that
          format. Consider any equipment, materials, or resources required for
          your talk.
        </p>

        <p>
          By avoiding these common pitfalls, you can increase your chances of
          submitting a successful proposal for a conference talk that aligns
          with the conference’s goals, is relevant to attendees, and delivers
          fresh insights or techniques.
