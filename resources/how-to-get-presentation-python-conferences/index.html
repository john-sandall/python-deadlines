          Python conferences are an excellent platform for sharing knowledge,
          networking with peers, and staying up-to-date with the latest
          developments in the Python community. Speaking at a Python conference
          can be a great opportunity if you’re passionate about Python and want
          to share your insights with a wider audience. In this blog post, we’ll
          explore how to get to speak at Python conferences.
        </p>

        <h2 id="be-invited">Be Invited</h2>
        <p>
          One way to get invited to speak at Python conferences is to have an
          established reputation in the community. Suppose you’ve contributed to
          open-source projects, written articles or blog posts about Python, or
          spoken at smaller meetups or events. In that case, you may catch the
          attention of conference organizers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, if you’re an expert in a specific field, such as machine
          learning or web development, you may be invited to speak at
          conferences that focus on those topics. To increase your chances of
          being invited, attend conferences and meetups, participate in online
          discussions, and contribute to the Python community in any way you
          can.
        </p>

        <h2 id="submit-a-proposal-to-a-call-for-proposal-cfp">
          Submit a Proposal to a Call for Proposal (CfP)
        </h2>

        <p>
          Another way to get to speak at Python conferences is to submit a
          proposal to a Call for Proposals (CfP). Most conferences open up CfPs
          several months before the event, and anyone can submit a proposal.
          When submitting a proposal, it’s essential to remember that conference
          organizers seek original and engaging talks that appeal to a diverse
          audience. Ensure your submission is well-written, clear, and concise
          and addresses a topic relevant and interesting to the Python
          community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are a few
          <a href="/resources/good-conference-talk-proposals/"
            >tips for submitting a successful proposal</a
          >:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose a topic you’re passionate about and have expertise in.</li>
          <li>
            Make sure your proposal is relevant to the conference theme or
            focus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write a compelling title and summary that will grab the attention of
            conference organizers and attendees.
          </li>
          <li>
            Outline your talk in detail, including what you’ll cover and how
            you’ll present it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Include any supporting materials, such as code samples or slides, to
            give organizers a better sense of your presentation style and
            content.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="build-your-speaking-skills">Build Your Speaking Skills</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re new to public speaking, it’s a good idea to start small by
          speaking at local meetups or events.
        </p>

        <p>
          This will help you build your confidence and refine your presentation
          skills. As you gain more experience, you can branch out and speak at
          larger events, such as regional or national conferences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ask for feedback from attendees and organizers after each talk, and
          use that feedback to improve your speaking skills.
        </p>

        <h2 id="network-with-other-speakers-and-attendees">
          Network with Other Speakers and Attendees
        </h2>
        <p>
          Finally, networking is vital to getting to speak at Python
          conferences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Attend as many conferences and meetups as possible, and try to connect
          with other speakers and attendees.
        </p>

        <p>
          By building relationships with other members of the Python community,
          you’ll increase your visibility and credibility, which can lead to
          more speaking opportunities in the future.
        </p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In conclusion, getting to speak at Python conferences requires a
          combination of expertise, preparation, and networking.
        </p>

        <p>
          By following these tips, you can increase your chances of being
          invited to speak or successfully submitting a proposal to a CfP and
          ultimately sharing your knowledge with the broader Python community.
